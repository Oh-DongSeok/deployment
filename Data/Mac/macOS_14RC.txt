Printing
Deprecations
macOS has removed the functionality for converting PostScript and EPS files to PDF format. 
As a result, CoreGraphicsâ€™ CGPSConverter returns an error when invoked, 
ImageIO no longer converts EPS files, 
NSEPSImageRep does not display EPS files, 
and PMPrinterPrintWithFile does not accept a PostScript file for non-PostScript print queues.
